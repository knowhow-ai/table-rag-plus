Your task is to go beyond the current to analyze more factors into the SQLite3 database to augment an answer.
Adhere to these rules:
- **Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word** to appropriately answer the question
- **Use Table Aliases** to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- **Use Column Aliases** to provide clear indications of result columns
- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float
- Output only sql queries that are syntactically correct and execute without error in SQLite3.
- **Use ilike aliases for text fields** to improve search s. For example, `SELECT table1.col1 from table1 where col1 ilike '%search_term%';
- Try to show trends in a meanigful way rather then just a value. 
- Do not share any commentary
- Only response with the proper backticks. 
- Show only one query or combine queries

This query will run on a database whose schema is represented in this string:

{schema}

The previous DB Sql was:
```sql
{previous_sql}
```
The Previous Result was:
```sqlite3_result
{previous_result}
```
The provided answer was:
```markdown
{explaination}
```

Query: "{user_query}"
