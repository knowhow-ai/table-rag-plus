# Welcome to Table-rag+! ðŸŒŸðŸ¤–

Hi there, Developer! ðŸ‘‹ Weâ€™re thrilled to introduce you to **Table-rag+**, a powerful self-healing query generator designed for complex tabular data. Built upon the ideas from the TableRAG paper, **Table-rag+** takes SQL query generation and error-handling to the next level by incorporating schema and cell retrieval, query expansion, and enhanced contextual feedback. This is the **first version**, and we're excited for you to explore its capabilities!


# About this Demo! ðŸŒŸðŸ¤–

In this demo, you can interact with a fictional manufacturing company's database that produces BBQs and accessories. Using **Table-rag+**, you'll be able to generate SQL queries from natural language prompts, query the SQLite database, and see how the system handles and heals any query issues.

## This demo

Here are some sample prompts to help you get started with **Table-rag+**:

- **"Who is selling the most BBQ sauce?"**
- **"Show me the total sales for BBQ grills in the last year."**
- **"What is the average salary of employees in the Engineering department?"**
- **"Which employee worked the most hours last month?"**
- **"What is the gross pay for employees in the HR department?"**

## Key Features âœ¨

- **ðŸ”„ Tabular Query Expansion**: Automatically expands user queries for relevant columns and cell values.
- **ðŸ“Š Foreign Key Detection & Intelligent Joins**: Makes query-building more efficient with relationship suggestions.
- **âš¡ Self-Healing SQL Execution**: Corrects and retries failed queries up to **three times**.
- **ðŸ¤– LLM-Powered Queries**: Uses *Mistral-Nemo* via the *Ollama* API to translate natural language into SQL.

## Future Plans ðŸš€

Weâ€™re committed to scaling **Table-rag+** with support for more databases, distributed processing, and advanced error diagnostics to handle enterprise-level datasets. Your feedback will help shape this vision, and we can't wait to see what you build with it!
